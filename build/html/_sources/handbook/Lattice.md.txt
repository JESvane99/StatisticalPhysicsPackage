#Lattice Theory

# Brillouin zone

:::{tip}
When drawing a zone draw the points halfway between neighboring points and then connect them
:::

Please refer to [Solid State Physics][solidstatephysics] for theory behind reciprocal space and brillouin zones.

:::{note}
The book is depicting the math, for info about how to draw. just read

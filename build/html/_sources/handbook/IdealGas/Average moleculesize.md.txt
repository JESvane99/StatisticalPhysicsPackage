# Average molecule size

```{attention} Not that important
The average size of a molecule can be found by rearanging the Ideal Gas law

$$
\frac{V}{N} = \frac{k T}{P} = 4.09 \cdot 10^{-26} m^3
$$(1)
```

```{math}
:label: idgs

P V = NkT = nRT
```

This is hardly important but can give a better intuition as to why the ideal gas is
not a bad approximation per se. F.x. a molecule of $H_2O$ has a size of $0.958 \cdot 10^{-10} m$ compared to the average size pr molecule which is just Eq.[(1)](1) taken by the cube root. $\left(\frac{V}{N}\right)^{1/3} = 3.45 \cdot 10^{-9} m$. From this it is clear that the average size of a molecule in an ideal gas is very insignificant.

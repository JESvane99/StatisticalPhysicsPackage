Use 'AnswerC.pdf' problem 2.34 when deriving $\Delta S = \frac{Q}{T}$
for an isothermal process with U fixed.

Use 'AnswerC.pdf' problem 3.25 when:

- deriving an expression for he entropy of
an Einstein solid as a function of N and q(where N is number of oscillators and
q is number of energy units).
- calculating the temperature of an Einstein solid as a function of its energy
- deriving an equation for the heat capacity, by using the energy as a function of temperature.
- Checking the limits of heat capacity at $T \rightarrow \infin$.
- showing a graph of heat capacity as a function of T:
